A nod to it's long history as a night school with candles and an Owl in the shield accompanied by a quirky half-moon over as a dot on the 'i'.

The decision to use lowercase rather than the more common uppercase approach creates the space for the moon/dot, but also having the ascenders of the k and b gives the wordmark a little more variety.
