A typographic only logo from Abertay University, that uses a [slab serif face, Serifa](http://typedia.com/explore/typeface/serifa/) to state the basic information simply, with the kind of modern voice that paradoxically, a 1960s can provide. The modern serif is direct, strong and clear. A clear break with the name and crest based logo the university had previously.

There was a quirky characteristic that I noticed - that on some documents the dots over the i's are absent yet on the website they are present. Which is the definitive logo is unclear. It seems rather an odd thing to do.
