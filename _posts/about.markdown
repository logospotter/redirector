    Excellent web site! However, there are at least three important ommissions from you list which I think you should correct as soon as possible:
    1. Manchester University (sometimes called the Victoria University of Manchester)
    2. The Open University
    3. Glasgow University
    
    Also do you know if anyone has collated the university shields in a similar way to your site?

A collection of reviews and information about logos used by UK Universities. I thought it would be interesting, educational and enjoyable to gather examples and research a little more about the logos and the particluar demands of designing for this sector.

### Getting Started

Right now I am in the early stages of producing what I hope will be a useful and enlightening guide and as such would be happy for anyone to point out things they like or where I could improve "Use the form to get in touch":http://logospotter.co.uk/contact

I'm working through a series of early reviews for various logos and then hope to revisit them with more in depth information once I've got up to speed.
