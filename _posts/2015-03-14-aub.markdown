The logo and typeface have gone to town on the curve meeting a straight edge motif, which softens the typeface and provides some interest to the containing shape.

It creates a pretty neutral, modern feel to the logo possibly with the intention that it is a flexible element in the organisations brand. The logo doesn't appear very much at all on the website which seems to back that up.
