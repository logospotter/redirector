Extremely simple logo consisting of a plain rendering of the University of Cumbria in what looks like a variation of Garamond, with the addition of a set of six leaves in place of the dot over the last i. Reminiscent of a nature related organisation I presume the leaves are a reflection of the very rural character and concerns of the university. Not sure how well it works since there's no real clue of an educational angle. I couldn't see if there was any significance in the numbers of leaves (perhaps campuses?).

The leaves themselves have a heavy outline and are angular rather than soft - slighty resembling flames.

A very simple choice of logo attempting to give a sense of the countryside that perhaps could work with a better implementation.
